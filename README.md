## About
Hi, I'm Haritha. With one year of experience at Incedo, I've been working as an analyst for AssetMark, a leading asset management firm. My role revolves around supporting both internal stakeholders, such as financial advisors, and external stakeholders, including investors. On a daily basis, I perform validation checks on customer funds and data, generate reports, and provide status updates to our internal team. I hold a BSc in Computer Science from Anna Adarsh College and recently obtained a data analytics certification from Simplilearn. In my free time, I enjoy reading books on personal finance and financial markets, I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data specialist.

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data Analyst and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.
