## About
Hi, I'm Haritha. With one year of experience at Incedo, I've been working as an Associate for AssetMark, a leading asset management firm. My role revolves around supporting both internal stakeholders, such as financial advisors, and external stakeholders, including investors. On a daily basis, I perform validation checks on customer funds and data, generate reports, and provide status updates to our internal team. I hold a BSc in Computer Science from Anna Adarsh College and recently obtained a data analytics certification from Simplilearn. In my free time, I enjoy reading books on personal finance and financial markets, I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data specialist.

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data Analyst and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

## Portfolio Projects

In this section, I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

## Python Projects
### App Ratings Prediction
### Code: [App Ratings Prediction.ipynb](https://github.com/Haritha1005/DATA-ANALYSIS-PORTFOLIO/blob/main/App%20Ratings%20Prediction.ipynb)

**Goal:** To build a model to predict the app rating based on various features provided in the Google Play Store dataset.

**Description:** The project involves thorough data analysis and preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the dataset for model building. It includes handling null values, correcting data types, performing outlier treatment, and conducting univariate and bivariate analysis to understand the relationship between different features and the target variable (app rating). The project also includes feature engineering, such as creating dummy variables for categorical features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. Finally, a linear regression model is built to predict app ratings, and the performance of the model is evaluated using the R2 score.

**Skills:** Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, linear regression, model evaluation.

**Technology:** 
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.

**Results:** The linear regression model achieved an R2 score of 0.1346 on the test set and 0.1946 on the train set. This indicates that the model explains 13.46% of the variance in the test data and 19.46% in the train data.

### Insurance Data Analysis

### Code: [Insurance Data Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/Haritha1005/DATA-ANALYSIS-PORTFOLIO/blob/main/Insurance%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)

**Goal:** To analyze the insurance dataset and create a model to predict the cost of medical insurance based on various input features.

**Description:** An insurance agency, ABC Insurance, wants to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on their dataset containing information about policyholders and claims to gain insights for better business decisions.

**Skills:** Data analysis, Exploratory data analysis (EDA), Data visualization, Feature engineering, Machine learning modeling

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

**Results:** Using Python and various data analysis libraries, the project successfully analyzed the insurance dataset. Key findings included the relationship between age, BMI, smoking status, and insurance charges. A machine learning model was built to predict insurance charges based on input features.

## SQL Projects

### Employee Performance Mapping

### Code: [ScienceQtech Employee Performance Mapping.sql](https://github.com/Haritha1005/DATA-ANALYSIS-PORTFOLIO/blob/main/ScienceQtech_Employee_Performance_Mapping.sql)

**Goal:** To analyze employee details, performance, and projects within ScienceQtech to derive insights for organizational improvement.

**Description:** This project focused on analyzing the employee database of ScienceQtech, a startup in the Data Science field. The dataset comprised employee information such as roles, departments, experience, salaries, performance ratings, and projects undertaken. Utilizing SQL queries, the analysis aimed to extract relevant insights on employee performance and project involvement. Key tasks included data importing, database creation, SQL queries execution, and performance optimization.

**Skills:** Data importing, Database management, SQL querying, Data analysis and reporting

**Technology:** MySQL Workbench, SQL

**Results:** The project provided insights into employee performance and project engagement within ScienceQtech. This included identifying high-performing employees, analyzing project contributions, and assessing performance trends. The analysis facilitated data-driven decision-making to enhance organizational effectiveness and identify areas for employee development.
