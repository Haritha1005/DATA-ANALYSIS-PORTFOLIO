## About

Hi, I'm Haritha, a finance and data analytics professional with experience in private market analysis, data management, and financial insights. Currently working as a Data Monitoring Analyst for Adams Street Partners, I specialize in managing financial datasets, automating workflows, and profiling new companies to support investment decisions. My work involves analyzing quarterly financials, managing cash flows, and categorizing companies based on sector, stage, and other key attributes.

To enhance efficiency, I leverage tools like Excel and SQL, performing tasks such as querying databases to extract insights and automating data processing for high volumes of documents. My role bridges financial expertise with technical skills, which I am actively advancing by practicing SQL for deeper analytical insights and process optimization.

With a strong foundation in data visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI, as well as programming in Python, I am eager to transition into a more technical role, focusing on data-driven solutions to complex problems.
